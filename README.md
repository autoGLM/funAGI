# funAGI
fundamental AGI point of departure for SimpleMind with logic and SocraticReasoning

FundamentalAGI Project Setup

codebase to create a simplified version called fundamentalAGI.py. This new script will use SocraticReasoning.py and logic.py with verbose logging to understand the export of the belief into ./memory/truth. This simplified version will omit reasoning.py and directly leverage the core logic and memory management. Here's how we will structure the project:

    fundamentalAGI.py: Main script to run the AGI.
    agi.py: Core AGI logic.
    api.py: API key management.
    bdi.py: BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) model.
    chatter.py: Interface for different chat models.
    logic.py: Logic table management and evaluation.
    memory.py: Memory management for storing dialogues and truth values.
    SocraticReasoning.py: Socratic reasoning engine for the AGI.
